here is the structure of a typical circuits file:

[name of transportation management company] [software version]                          [name of school board]                                                                                                          [page number]

Precisions:

as long as the following pages are describing the same itinirary and circuit, the structure will change to the following: 

[name of transportation management company] [software version]                          [name of school board]                                                                                                          [page number]
[type of document]                                                                         [type of notice]                                                                                 [date and time the document was produced]
                                                                                        [entity this concerns]                                                                                            [school year this concerns]


[name of transporation company: name]                                                                          [circuit: number] [type: AM/PM] [id of itinirary]                               [following page written in between ()] 
[following page writtin in between ()]   

[type of point: ARR, BAT, DOM, TRSF, TRF]  [location of point: value]   [precise time when the driver needs to be at this location]    [number of students to pick up: number] [number of students that leave at this point: number]

[student's name]       [Education level]   [Grade level and year within cycle]  [checkmark indicating if split custody or not]   [full address]  [telephone number if any]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then when a new itinirary starts the first structure will come back.

As for the following abbreviations here are their respective meanings:
ARR: Arrêt (Bus Stop)
BAT: Bâtiment (Building/School)
Emb: Embarquement (Boarding)
Déb: Débarquement (Total on board)
GPar: Garde partagée (Split custody)
TRSF/TRF: Point de transfer (Connection locations)

As for the value of the location point, it varies according to the abbreviation that comes before it such that:

ARR: means the value is of this format: street name/street name and represents an intersection.
BAT: means the following format: name of school.
TRSF/TRF: usually means the name of a landmark or building.

here is the typical structure of a notice of circuit's modifications:
